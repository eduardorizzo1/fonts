# ubuntu-mono-ligaturized
Ubuntu Mono font with programming ligatures.

This is a direct export from the output of [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer#automatic), with some CSS glue derived from [FiraCode CSS](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/blob/master/distr/fira_code.css).

This repo was created so that the fonts can be hosted on GitHub and UNPKG, for demo use in code samples.
